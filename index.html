	<center><p>Though there are a handful of ways to help lower the risk of a house fire, it is important to keep in mind that there is no<br>100% guaranteed way to prevent one. These methods used to prevent a house fire can only decrease the possibility<br>of a house fire, not completely stop one from happening. However, these would very much aid in avoiding a fire<br>from happening.</p></center><br>
